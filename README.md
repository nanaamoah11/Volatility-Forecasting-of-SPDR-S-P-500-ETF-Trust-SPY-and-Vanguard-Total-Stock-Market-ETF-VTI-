# Volatility-Forecasting-of-SPDR-S-P-500-ETF-Trust-SPY-and-Vanguard-Total-Stock-Market-ETF-VTI-

### Overview
This project aims to forecast the volatility of SPY and VTI ETFs using garch model. The forecasted volatility can provide valuable insights for investors and traders in managing risk and making informed decisions in the stock market.

### Data Source
The historical price data for SPY and VTI ETFs was obtained from the AlphaVantage API. The dataset includes daily open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume.

### Data Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- Open: Opening price of the ETF
- High: Highest price of the ETF during the day
- Low: Lowest price of the ETF during the day
- Close: Closing price of the ETF
- Volume: Trading volume of the ETF

The data spans a specific timeframe, providing daily price observations for SPY and VTI ETFs.

### Methodology
We utilize garch model to forecast the volatility of SPY and VTI ETFs. Graph models leverage the relationships between various data points to predict future volatility levels accurately.

### Usage
